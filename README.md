# Lending Club Case Study
> A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers has the following business requirement. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
Problem statement is to identify patterns that can provide guidance to the company to predict applicant’s loan repayment behavior and accordingly approve loan application.

## Overall Approach for Analysis
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- What is the dataset that is being used?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Data Sourcing & Data Cleaning
- Data Sourcing : Data provided for the case study in the module has been used

- Data Cleaning Steps:
Missing Value Check
Dropping columns with more than or equal to 60% null values
Checking for unique counts
Identifying sample dataset by applying filter on “Loan Status” = ‘Charged off’ for the analysis
